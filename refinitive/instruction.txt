For the programming questions below, pseudo code may be implemented in C, C++ or Java unless otherwise stated.  Definition of pseudo code:  we��re looking for the question to be answered using a programming language and not necessarily checking for exact/valid syntax.

 

1)      Create sample code to support sending and receiving any message sizes from users between server and client via TCP protocol. But the actual message size is configurable on the server side to ensure that both server and client can send message to each other less than the configured message size.  The code must ensure that both server and client sides receive the entire message size from users. The code should be extendable to support future messaging feature. Please provide data structure for handling message as well.

2)      Create details design using sequence or activity diagram for users to register an interest via subject name and the design is able to notify users once it receives any messages with the specified interest from the network. The design must support multiple interests and users can stop receiving the interests anytime. Users must be notified when the connection is lost. Please provide data structure for this design as well.

3)      For a singly and doubly linked list, give us C or C++ pseudo code for the following functions:

a.       Add: add_to_list(List* linkedList, int value)

b.      Delete: delete_from_list(List* linkedList, int value)

c.       Reverse: reverse_list(List* linkedList)

d.      Bonus question: do the reverse in-place without creating new structures
